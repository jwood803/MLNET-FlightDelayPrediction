# ML.NET Flight Delay Prediction
Using ML.NET to predict flight delays. Initial idea came from [this Microsoft lab](https://github.com/microsoft/computerscience/tree/master/Labs/Deep%20Learning/200%20-%20Machine%20Learning%20in%20Python) that makes this machine learning model in Python using pandas and scikit-learn. This is an ML.NET port of that project.
